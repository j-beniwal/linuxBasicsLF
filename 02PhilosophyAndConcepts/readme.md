Before you begin using Linux, you need to be aware of some basic terms such as kernel, distribution, boot loader, service, filesystem, X Window system, desktop environment, and command line. These are very commonly used by the Linux community.

**kernel**
The *kernel* is considered the brain of the Linux operating system. It controls the hardware and makes the hardware interact with the applications. An example of a kernel is the Linux kernel. The most recent Linux kernel, along with past Linux kernels, can be found at the kernel.org web site.

**distribution**
A *distribution* also known as Distros is a collection of programs combined with the Linux kernel to make up a Linux-based operating system. Some common examples of a distribution are Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Ubuntu, and Gentoo.

**boot loader**
The *boot loader*, as the name implies, is a program that boots the operating system. Two examples of a boot loader are GRUB and ISOLINUX.

**service**
A *service* is a program that runs as a background process. Some examples of the service are httpd, nfsd, ntpd, ftpd and named.

**filesystem**
A *filesystem* is a method for storing and organizing files in Linux. Some examples of filesystems are ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS and Btrfs.

**X Window System**
The *X Window System* provides the standard toolkit and protocol to build graphical user interfaces on nearly all Linux systems.

**desktop environment**
The *desktop environment* is a graphical user interface on top of the operating system. GNOME, KDE, Xfce and Fluxbox are some examples of the desktop environment.

**command line**
The *command line* is an interface for typing commands on top of the operating system.

**Shell**
The *Shell* is the command line interpreter that interprets the command line input and instructs the operating system to perform any necessary tasks and commands. For example, bash, tcsh and zsh.
